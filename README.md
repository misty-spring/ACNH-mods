# ACNH-mods
A repository for my ACNH mods.

## About
A while ago, I began making ACNH mods (partly inspired by some I saw floating around). 

Despite not keeping them up to date anymore, I'm still posting them: in case they're to anyone's taste/preference, and to serve as an archive for myself (in case I ever decide to come back to this).

\*\* These mods haven't been thoroughly tested, and I'm not maintaining them currently. \*\*
